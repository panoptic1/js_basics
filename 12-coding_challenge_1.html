        Mark and John are both trying to calculate their BMI. This can be done iwht the following formula:
        BMI = mass / height^2 
        or...
        BMI = mass / (height * height)
        (mass is in kg and height is in meters)
        1. Store Mark and John's mass and height in variables
        2. Calculate both of their BMIs
        3. Create a boolean variable containing information about whether Mark's BMI is higher than John's
        4. Print a string to the console saying something like "It is (true/false) that John's BMI is higher than Mark's"
        */

        johnBMI = johnWeight / johnHeight ^ 2;
